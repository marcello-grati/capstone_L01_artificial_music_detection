# capstone L01 : artificial music detection

This repository containes 3 different codes focused on testing new way to perform artificial music detection:

- `Capstone_l01_RvF.ipynb` : this model is trained to distinguish between human recorded music and AI generated music
- `Capstone_l01_RvF.ipynb` : this model is trained to classify the music generated by different AI models
- `Noise_test.ipynb` : this code is useful to test model perfromance in different noise scenarios

In order to run this code, the user needs to add this dataset to his google drive folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1--JvLlLr_JZeOtfK3jgNJm7_EBBIlxYr?usp=sharing

and then needs to modify the file paths with respect to the postion of the added folder

Es: `/content/drive/My Drive/path/to/folder/Datasets_5/...`
